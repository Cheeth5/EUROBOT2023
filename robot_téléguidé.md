# robot_téléguidé

the first robot is a teleguided robot by a ps2 controller . Its purpose is to take the cake disks and put a cheery on top of it
we used a motor driver (bts7960) , an arduino mega  , 2 motors and a ps2 controller and a ps2 receiver

for the cherry system we used a pipe and a servo motors at the end so with the controller we can open the servo motor so we put the 
cherry on top of the cakes
